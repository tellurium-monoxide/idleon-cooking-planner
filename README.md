# idleon-tools

This is a collection of tools for the game IdleOn I make for my own use. They are accessible as github pages at <a href="https://tellurium-monoxide.github.io/idleon-tools/" target="_blank">https://tellurium-monoxide.github.io/idleon-tools/</a>.

## cooking-planner
- Gives meal upgrades list with cost in ladles (same as IT)
- Estimates time to max cooking with NMLB, equinox cost redux and ladle production
- Customizable account stats so you can see which bonus you are missing

## Future tools
I plan to make tools for the following purposes: 
- Booking talent plannification / organizer

Those are probably already covered in some google sheet, but I dislike using these for advanced calculations.

## Contributing
You can contribute by reporting bugs or give suggestions for improvements using Github issues.
